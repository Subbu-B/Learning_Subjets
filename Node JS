Everything you need to know about underscore template is here. Only 3 things to keep in mind:

<%  %> - to execute some code
<%= %> - to print some value in template
<%- %> - to print some values HTML escaped
That's all about it.

Simple example:

var tpl = _.template("<h1>Some text: <%= foo %></h1>");
then tpl({foo: "blahblah"}) would be rendered to the string <h1>Some text: blahblah</h1>
