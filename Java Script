JavaScript provides 3 places to put the JavaScript code: within body tag, within head tag and external JavaScript file.

Letâ€™s create the first JavaScript example.

<script type="text/javascript">  
document.write("JavaScript is a simple language for javatpoint learners");  
</script>  

The script tag specifies that we are using JavaScript.

The text/javascript is the content type that provides information to the browser about the data.

The document.write() function is used to display dynamic content through JavaScript. We will learn about document object in detail later.
